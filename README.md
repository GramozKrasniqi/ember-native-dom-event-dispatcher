# ember-native-dom-event-dispatcher

`ember-native-dom-event-dispatcher` is intended to be used with Ember 2.9.0-alpha.1 and higher.
It replaces the default event dispatcher in use by Ember apps with one that does not use jQuery.

In general, this should be a drop in replacement for `Ember.EventDispatcher` (which is the default).
